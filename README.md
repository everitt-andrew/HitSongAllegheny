# Hit Song Analysis
Official repository for data and source code for Andrew C. Everitt's thesis project.

## Usage
Please download RStudio [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) if you
haven't done so already and then follow the instructions to install once opening
the file.

Once RStudio has been installed, ensure that the version is at least 3.6.2, the
version in which the project was developed. Future versions may affect the usability
of some commands.

The code can be found in the src directory. After it has been opened, the user must
download the tidyverse package by typing the command "Install.packages("tidyverse")"
into the console. Furthermore, after the operation has been completed, the user must
activate the package by entering the command "library(tidyverse)" into the console.
The only necessary quotations are those inside the parenthesis of the install command.
Finally, the graphs used in the thesis document can be recreated by clicking on the
run command. They can be navigated through the plots tab. If an error finding the
data occurs, ensure that the data sets from the data directory are imported. For
additional comments or questions, please contact the developer.
